# RejectedByUBC
Offering students that have been rejected from UBC with further life options!

## Inspiration
As I scrolled on my Facebook feed, procrastinating my side projects, I would come across posts made by the UBC Confessions page. Anyone that follows the page would know that memes belittling UBC's rival univeristy (SFU) frequents the site. Sometimes, mentions of BCIT and Capilano University also frequent the site.

As a result, I found inspiration in my procrastination to make this fun and simple side project!
Enjoy :)

PS: this is not intended to hurt anyone's feelings. All universities listed are (personally) highly regarded!! Please take it as is -- a joke.
